- This is a wordpress plugin
- To run PHPUnit tests, run lando phpunit
- To run playwright tests, run `lando playwright` or `lando playwright-html`
- The frontend is primarily React.
- The backend is primarily PHP.
- Never ever use jquery.
- Strongly favor simplicity and concision when making solutions. Do not over-engineer.
- When writing playwright tests, use .pressSequentially with a delay of 100ms when inputting text into html elements.
- WordPress wraps React in @wordpress/element, so that is what should be used for importing things like useState, useEffect, etc.
- When solving problems, make minimal incremental changes. Don't go wild solving a problem in many different ways. Solve it the simplest way possible. If that doesn't work, we can try a different approach then.
