# Museum for WordPress

Museum for WordPress is a WordPress plugin that facilitates the operation of an
online museum. It is a full-featured museum management system that is tightly
integrated into the powerful and user-friendly WordPress software. It is
desiged to operate seamlessly with any WordPress theme, while also giving
administrators and authors full power to customize the appearance of museum
objects.

Administrators create museum objects with custom fields
and built-in image galleries. Collections display associated objects. The
appearance of objects and collections is fully configurable through the
WordPress customization API, and they can be integrated into posts and pages
throughout the site with widgets and Gutenberg blocks.

Using the [Museum Remote
plugin](https://github.com/mikethicke/wp-museum/tree/master/museum-remote),
other WordPress sites can embed collections from a central Museum for WordPress
site using the WordPress REST API.
