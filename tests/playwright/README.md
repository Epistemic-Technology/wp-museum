# Playwright Tests

This directory is reserved for Playwright end-to-end (E2E) tests.

## Getting Started

Playwright tests are not yet implemented. When ready, this directory will contain:

- Browser automation tests
- End-to-end user journey tests
- Integration tests across the full application stack

## Future Structure

```
playwright/
├── README.md              # This file
├── playwright.config.js   # Playwright configuration
├── tests/                 # Test files
│   ├── admin/            # Admin interface tests
│   ├── frontend/         # Public-facing tests
│   └── api/              # API integration tests
├── fixtures/             # Test data and fixtures
└── utils/                # Helper functions and utilities
```

## Installation (Future)

```bash
# Install Playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Install browsers
npx playwright install
```

## Running Tests (Future)

```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
npx playwright test

# Run tests in headed mode
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/admin/dashboard.spec.js
```

## Notes

- This directory structure separates E2E tests from PHPUnit unit tests
- Playwright tests will complement the existing PHPUnit test suite
- Tests will cover user interactions, UI functionality, and cross-browser compatibility
